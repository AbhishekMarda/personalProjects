This project was made during UCLA Winter Quarter 2020. 
The files Actor.cpp, Actor.h, StudentWorld.cpp, and StudentWorld.h were made by me, Abhishek Marda. 
All other files were supplied by the UCLA CS department for CS 32 under the instructors David Smallberg and Carey Nachenberg and request that any distributions or modifications made to those files be made upon the appropriate permission from the UCLA CS department. I do not take any credit for the files in this project apart from Actor.cpp, Actor.h, StudentWorld.cpp, and StudentWorld.h. 

The files here are here to showcase my coding practices and concept clarity. The files by themselves will not execute. They require external software installations such as XQuartz.
